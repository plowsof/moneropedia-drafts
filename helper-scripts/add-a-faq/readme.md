### "A step by step guide would be too complex to follow."
Lets change that, and organise everything in alphabetic order too    
- git clone the repo     
- pip install the deps    
- place in outside/next to your monero-site folder    
- edit the top of the `add_a_faq.py` file with your question/answer/key    
- or run the `faq_alphabetic_order.py` to order your existing index page
